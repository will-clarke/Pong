Idea: use a second thread to detect input. That way, were don't have to worry about hacking nurses to be non blocking. 

** Stuff to get this working:
- add random shapes in. eg. have swirling triangles in 'hard' mode
- Add sdl or something.. make this properly graphical.
- improve key-press cycle (include toggle)

*** TODO:
- [ ] benchmark different intersection algorithms to find the most efficient
- [ ] ? Rename line to line segment & generally rename words about lines / segments / chords / rays / points / slopes etc...
-
*** Other things to think about
- how generic do we want to make this?
**** Toggle
input: paused_toggle: bool
state: paused: bool

only update config when input is released
-> input paused == true && keyboard event: paused == false
