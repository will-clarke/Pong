*** TODO:
- [ ] Create angles / reflection code
  - I think we'll have to do the cumborsome way of:
    - Finding *nearest* intersection point
    - Finding distance to intersection poing
    - Finding angle to draw from intersection point
    - Drawing from intersection point (and the searching for another intersecting line): back to the first step
- [ ] benchmark different intersection algorithms to find the most efficient
- [ ] ? Rename line to line segment & generally rename words about lines / segments / chords / rays / points / slopes etc...
  - We need some way of differnetiating lines which are [(x,y), (x,y)] and lines which are y = 2x + 4 (<- slopes?)
- [X] Create a to_slope method for Vectors ?
-
*** Other things to think about
- units - surely uints are better?
- floats are presumably bad
- how generic do we want to make this?
