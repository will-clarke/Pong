Idea: use a second thread to detect input. That way, were don't have to worry about hacking nurses to be non blocking.

** To implement next
- shape rotation:
    - state.shape becomes a load of vectors
    - we add an extra struct: Shape { relative_vecs: origin: }
    - we add a matrix geometry struct & implement multiplications
    - add rotation to the matrix's functions.
    - profit

*** todo:
- add random shapes in. eg. have swirling triangles in 'hard' mode
- Add sdl or something.. make this properly graphical.
- improve key-press cycle (include toggle)
- benchmark different intersection algorithms to find the most efficient
- ? Rename line to line segment & generally rename words about lines / segments / chords / rays / points / slopes etc...

*** Other things to think about
- how generic do we want to make this?

**** Toggle
input: paused_toggle: bool
state: paused: bool

only update config when input is released
-> input paused == true && keyboard event: paused == false
