:tada: Features: :tada:
 - Hours of endless gameplay
 - Top notch ASCII graphics
 - Unbeatably intelligent AI (wall will always return the ball)
 - Embedded in a real terminal

** To install
~cargo run~

** Dev TODO list:
  Idea: use a second thread to detect input. That way, were don't have to worry about hacking nurses to be non blocking.
  
*** Todo:
    - fix travis ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
    - separate thread for input
    - GUI
      - Add sdl or something.. make this properly graphical.
    - ? random blocks you can shoot or something ?
    - refactor - proper I/O
    - make proper binary
    - Add persistance for high scores
    - improve key-press cycle (include toggle)

*** Would be nice
    - benchmark different intersection algorithms to find the most efficient
    - play l_paddle automatically
    - menu
